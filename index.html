          # What is Spotify Backstage?

          A brief introduction to Spotify's Backstage framework

          ## Backstage from a Bird's Eye

          * Suite of NPM libraries and CLI tools
            * No more an application than Angular or React
          * CLI tool builds monorepo with Backstage libs as dependencies
          * Monorepo has: backend, frontend, public libs, private libs
          * Backend is ExpressJS HTTP server
          * Frontend is Material UI single-page app
          * Build system configuration is in place for easy addition of new libs
        </textarea>

        <textarea data-template>
          ## What's in this Backstage-based Monorepo?

          * At its core, a **(mostly) empty bike shed**, ready to be filled with whatever you can imagine
          * **Entity Catalog:** catalog software, infrastructure resources, people, teams, etc
          * **Documentation-as-code:** a place to read your collection of [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)-generated
            documentation
          * **Software templater:** Scaffold new software projects, create and publish new VCS repos

          ## Why is that special?

          Backstage functionality provided out-of-the-box can be replicated with other products...<br />
          but Backstage provides it in:
          * easy-to-modify package
          * hosted on your own servers
          * maintained by your own developers
          * expanded by your own team.

          If you want the ability to control your own fate and not wait for a third-party to solve your problems, Backstage
          may be for you.
